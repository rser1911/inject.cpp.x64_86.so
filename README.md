This is library for look and change calls between shared library and main code for x64\_86.

Also you can hook object with virtual objects (vtable)

```
inject.cpp - main code of injection library
inject_user.cpp - code for looking and changin calls
inject.h - autogenerated by do script file with description for functions and methods
classes - class names for do script for generation inject.h

lib.h - define inteface of test library
lib.cpp - realisation of test library
main.cpp - usage test library

do - main script for building and generation inject.h
edb - script for debuging
Makefile - call do script
```

Requirements: g++, ctags, clang

clang used for generation vtables for inject.h like this:

```
VTable indices for 'Base' (3 entries).
   0 | int Base::Magic()
   1 | Base::~Base() [complete]
   2 | Base::~Base() [deleting]
```

`g++ -fdump-class-hierarchy` *is not usable for this becouse generate \_\_cxa\_pure\_virtual for names*

Output for `./do` 

```

   [ NORMAL RUN ]

Magic() = 100500
~ Derived
~ Base

   [ inject.so RUN ]

@ > FactoryBase [1] --- EXPORT Base* FactoryBase();
@ < FactoryBase [1], ret = 0x55e96d881320
@ << HOOKED Base object
@ > Base::Magic [0] --- int Base::Magic(), obj = 0x55e96d881320
@ > Base::UNKNOWN [3] --- ???, obj = 0x55e96d881320
@ < Base::UNKNOWN [3 = One], ret = 10
@ < Base::Magic [0], ret = 1005000, obj = 0x55e96d881320
@ << Base::Magic, changed ret = 100500
Magic() = 100500
@ > Base::~Base [2] --- Base::~Base() [deleting], obj = 0x55e96d881320
~ Derived
~ Base
@ < Base::~Base [2], ret = 0, obj = 0x55e96d881320
@ << UNHOOKED Base object

```

No support for RTTI now.
